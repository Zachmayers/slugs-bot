**3. Specifying Who is Being Spoken To**

If there's a large group of people in the scene, and you need to specify who is being spoken to by one of the characters in the scene, you can use a parenthetical.

```
		ELENA
I don't understand why you're
defending him! He's an asshole
and he's obviously the one who
left the seat up! It's his
fault!

		SHAWN
You just want to blame him
because it's convenient! Think 
about it! What evidence do you 
really have that he pissed in
that toilet at that time on
that night?

		JORDAN

Yo, this is just like that
movie 12 ANGRY MEN.
