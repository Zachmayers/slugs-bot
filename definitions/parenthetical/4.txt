**4. Pauses and Micro-Actions**

You can add a pause or small action into a parenthetical to break up longer sections of dialogue. This helps with pacing how quickly your script will be read, and also helps to add or remove emphasis to the action.

```
		MYLES
I just - I need you to 
understand that this is hard
for me to talk about. I'm
not used to asking people
this, but I think you're worth
it, Sophie. I have to ask you.
	(beat)
Will you trade Yu-Gi-Oh cards 
with me?

		SOPHIE
Oh, Myles, sweetie, I was 
scared you would never ask! 
I've been waiting for so
long for you to ask!
	(hugs him)
Of course I'll trade Yu-
Gi-Oh cards with you!
