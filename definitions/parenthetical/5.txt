		BRANDON
Hey, your name is like that one
guy from Les Mis! Do you like
Les Mis? What's your favorite
line from Les Mis?

		JAVERT
	(in French)
I hate you with all of my being
and I hope you cry tonight and 
don't know why.

		BRANDON
Oh, awesome! What does that
mean?

		JAVERT
	(in English)
Uh, it means "oooh oh boy we're
French and we're revolting, down
with the aristocracy hahaha."
