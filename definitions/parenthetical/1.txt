**1. Emotion and Delivery**

In general, you don't want to use parentheticals for this unless it is both *unclear or ambiguous* and *critical to the story*, because it is the actor's job to interpret the character and their feelings in the story through their delivery. If there is a case like this, though, a parenthetical is appropriate.

Nicole walks into the living room. Owen is sitting in his chair, watching a western on the television.

		NICOLE
Look at you. You made it a
whole month. I'm proud of
you, Owen.

Owen is quiet. He doesn't turn or react.

		NICOLE
Sweetie?

		OWEN
	(slurring)
I'm sorry, sweetie, I- I 
messsed up.
