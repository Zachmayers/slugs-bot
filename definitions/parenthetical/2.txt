**2. Simultaneous Action**

If there's an action that occurs simultaneously with, and connected to, a line of dialogue, it can be put into a parenthetical. In general, it's good practice to keep most actions in action lines, but, in some cases, a parenthetical can be used.

```
Dr. Calamity lays on the ground, finally bested. Heroman lands with a BOOM on the ground next to him. He stands and approaches Dr. Calamity, who flinches. Heroman extends a hand to help the evil Doctor up.

		HEROMAN
We have bigger things to worry
about than each other. Are you
ready to help me?

		DR. CALAMITY
It seems I'm left without much
choice, right?

		HEROMAN
It's either me or the giant
meteor. What do you pick?

		DR. CALAMITY
	(takes his hand)
As nice as the meteor sounds,
I suppose I'll help you.
