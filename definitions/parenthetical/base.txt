**Parenthetical**

A parenthetical is a short description that modifies a line of dialogue in a screenplay. It is written in a dialogue block between a character name and the dialogue itself.

```
        JACOB
Sir, we have an opportunity that
we might never get again! I need
you to authorize my server time.

        HAYES
    (indifferent)
Server time is valuable, we can't
give it to everyone who asks. The
answer is no. Is there anything 
else?
```

Parentheticals can be used for many types of directions in a script that directly affect a single line of dialogue. These include:

1. Emotion / Delivery
2. Simultaneous action
3. Specifying who is being spoken to
4. Pauses and micro-actions
5. Language changes
